# Changelog

All notable changes to ClearRoad (דרך ברורה) are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Email study reminders: Vercel Cron fires every minute, queries `user_schedule` for users due in Israel time with `notify = true`, sends Hebrew reminder email via Resend
- `createAdminClient()` in `src/lib/supabase.ts` for server-side admin operations using the service role key
- `getUsersDueNow()` in `src/lib/db.ts` to find scheduled users matching current Israel day and time
- `GET /api/cron/notify` route protected by `CRON_SECRET`, dispatches emails via Resend
- `vercel.json` registering the cron job on a `* * * * *` schedule
- Medal earn celebration: quiz page now shows a modal when `POST /api/quiz` returns `medals_earned`; supports queuing multiple medals, dismiss via button or scrim tap, never auto-dismisses
- Design system: added `MedalCelebration` component (`components/gamification/`) and `medal-earned.html` reference screen
- Topic completion detection: after a correct answer, check if all questions in the topic have been answered correctly at least once; call POST /api/progress with status "completed" automatically
- Quiz route now returns `topic_completed: boolean` in its response
- `checkTopicCompletion` helper in `src/lib/topic-completion.ts` with 7 unit tests
- 8 handler-level tests for POST /api/quiz (auth guard, input validation, completion logic)
- Vitest test framework with jsdom environment and React Testing Library

### Fixed
- Progress route no longer downgrades topic status from "completed" to "in_progress"
- Quiz UI updates reward message to "כל הכבוד! סיימת את כל הנושא!" when topic is completed

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Quiz: hide question image for sign-identification questions (all options are sign numbers) — image was revealing the correct answer
- Quiz: allow changing answer selection freely before confirming; feedback is now shown only after clicking "בדקי תשובה"
- Quiz: instant correct/wrong feedback from embedded `data-correct` attribute — no longer blocked on API round-trip
- Quiz: remove meaningless sign number label from answer options; show sign image only
- Quiz: sign images with white backgrounds now blend cleanly against green/red feedback colors via `mix-blend-mode: multiply`
- Quiz: sign-identification questions with missing question images no longer filtered out (image is not shown anyway)

- Flashcard back face: OCR-extracted sign numbers replaced with real Hebrew names via `cleanName()`
