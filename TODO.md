# TODO

Pre-planned 2026-07-17. Each item lists root cause, exact files, and approach so an execution workspace can start with zero re-discovery. Suggested execution order at the bottom.

Architecture facts every item relies on:

- All pages are async server components; styling is CSS Modules + design-system tokens (no Tailwind). Interactivity is vanilla JS in `public/js/*` reading translations from `window.__t` / `window.__tf` / `window.__locale`, injected by `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx:62-98` from the `JS.*` namespaces of `messages/{he,ar}.json`.
- DB queries live in `src/lib/db.ts`; domain logic in `src/lib/{gamification,personalization,topic-card,readiness,exam}.ts`.
- Migrations: `seeds/migrations/NNN_*.sql`, highest is `016`, so next is `017` (renumber right before push; main moves fast).
- Every new UI string goes into both `messages/he.json` and `messages/ar.json`. No emoji, no em-dash (lint-enforced).

## Items

1. **Persist derived achievements to `user_medals`.**
    Schema is ready (`schema.sql:47-53`: open TEXT slug, UNIQUE, own-insert RLS). Today only streak medals are written (RPC `010:337-349`); the four derived achievements come from `deriveAchievements` (`gamification.ts:124-144`; the comment at `:117-122` already names this follow-up) on each More render. Fix: app-layer check-and-insert in `/api/quiz` (and `/api/exam` for exam-pass) after the RPC - compute derived achievements, insert newly earned slugs, and append them to the response's `medals_earned` so the existing celebration pipeline fires (`quiz.js:717-719` into `medalQueue` and `buildMedalModal`). Extend `MEDAL_META` (`quiz.js:324+`) and add the four slugs' strings to he + ar. The More page then reads earned dates from `user_medals` instead of recomputing (fixes all-topics un-earning).

## Execution order (minimizes cross-item conflicts)

1. Derived achievements: 1 (medals).

Conflict hotspots when workspaces overlap: `messages/*.json` (most items), `public/js/quiz.js` (1).
